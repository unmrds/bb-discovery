# Repositories: Open Data Infrastructure

## Open Data: Why?

Policies and drivers include federal and other funder requirements:

* White House Office of Science and Technology Policy memo, [_Expanding Public Access to the Results of Federally Funded Research_](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2013/02/22/expanding-public-access-results-federally-funded-research)
* [Gates Foundation Open Access Policy](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/how-we-work/general-information/open-access-policy)

The list goes on - NSF, NIH, DoE, DoD...

Policy (sticks) aside, there is likewise research into the cultural, scientific, and social benefits of making data open and reusable (carrots). The [Fair Guiding Principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) provide a nice overview as well as a pretty useful acronym of what _open_ means regarding data:

**F**indable
**A**ccessible
**I**nteroperable
**R**eusable

We note the NSF is currently funding projects around research and data re-use.

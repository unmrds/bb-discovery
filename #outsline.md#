Repositories of various types are increasingly important in the preservation, discovery, access, and reuse of research data. This workshop is focused on fostering a discussion around the various interests that are in play in the development, use, and selection of specific repositories - both as sources for discovering and accessing data for reuse, but also for sharing and preservation of research project products. 

## Classes of Repositories

Repositories may be categorized in a number of different ways, depending upon needs:

* Compliance with standards that define trustworthyness or other measures of reliability, such as
  * [Trusted Digital Repository (TDR) Checklist](http://www.crl.edu/sites/default/files/d6/attachments/pages/trac_0.pdf)[^TDR], or its successor 
  * Trustworthy Digital Repositories - [ISO 16363](

Repositories of various types are increasingly important in the preservation, discovery, access, and reuse of research data. This workshop is focused on fostering a discussion around the various interests that are in play in the development, use, and selection of specific repositories - both as sources for discovering and accessing data for reuse, but also for sharing and preservation of research project products. 

## Classes of Repositories

Repositories may be categorized in a number of different ways, depending upon needs:

Compliance with standards that define trustworthyness,  measures of reliability, or other predefined characteristics, such as the

  * [Trusted Digital Repository (TDR) Checklist](http://www.crl.edu/sites/default/files/d6/attachments/pages/trac_0.pdf)[^TDR], or its successor 
  * Trustworthy Digital Repositories - [ISO 16363](https://www.iso.org/standard/56510.html)[^ISO]/[CCSDS 652.0-M-1](https://public.ccsds.org/pubs/652x0m1.pdf)[^CCSDS]
  * [Data Seal of Approval](https://www.datasealofapproval.org/en/)[^DSA]

Types of content that those repositories focus on:

* **Disciplinary repositories** that specialize in content produced by specific research disciplines such as [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/landing.jsp)[^ICPSR] for social science data, the [Archaeology Data Service](http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/][^ADS] for archaeological data, and [GenBank](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)[^GenBank] for genetic sequence data. 
* **General or Interdisciplinary repositories** that contain content that cross disciplinary boundaries, and may also contain multiple types of content including data, documents, and multi-media files.

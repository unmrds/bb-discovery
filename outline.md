Repositories of various types are increasingly important in the preservation, discovery, access, and reuse of research data. This workshop is focused on fostering a discussion around the various interests that are in play in the development, use, and selection of specific repositories - both as sources for discovering and accessing data for reuse, but also for sharing and preservation of research project products. 

# Repositories: Open Data Infrastructure

## Open Data: Why?

Policies and drivers include federal and other funder requirements:

* White House Office of Science and Technology Policy memo, [_Expanding Public Access to the Results of Federally Funded Research_](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2013/02/22/expanding-public-access-results-federally-funded-research)[^OSTP]
* [Gates Foundation Open Access Policy](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/how-we-work/general-information/open-access-policy)[^Gates]

The list goes on - NSF, NIH, DoE, DoD...

Policy (sticks) aside, there is likewise research into the cultural, scientific, and social benefits of making data open and reusable (carrots). The [Fair Guiding Principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)[^FAIR] provide a nice overview as well as a pretty useful acronym of what _open_ means regarding data:

**F**indable
**A**ccessible
**I**nteroperable
**R**eusable

We note the NSF is currently funding projects around research and data re-use.

## Classes of Repositories

Repositories may be categorized in a number of different ways, depending upon needs:

Compliance with standards that define trustworthyness,  measures of reliability, or other predefined characteristics, such as the

  * [Trusted Digital Repository (TDR) Checklist](http://www.crl.edu/sites/default/files/d6/attachments/pages/trac_0.pdf)[^TDR], or its successor 
  * Trustworthy Digital Repositories - [ISO 16363](https://www.iso.org/standard/56510.html)[^ISO]/[CCSDS 652.0-M-1](https://public.ccsds.org/pubs/652x0m1.pdf)[^CCSDS]
  * [Data Seal of Approval](https://www.datasealofapproval.org/en/)[^DSA]

Types of content that those repositories focus on:

* **Disciplinary repositories** that specialize in content produced by specific research disciplines such as [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/landing.jsp)[^ICPSR] for social science data, the [Archaeology Data Service](http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/)[^ADS] for archaeological data, and [GenBank](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)[^GenBank] for genetic sequence data. 
* **General or Interdisciplinary repositories** that contain content that cross disciplinary boundaries, and may also contain multiple types of content including data, documents, and multi-media files. 

Or, the organizations that host/manage the repositories - frequently as a designated repository for data products produced by or with funds from those organizations. For example:

* [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset)[^DataGov] - the discovery portal for data generated and provided by US Federal Government agencies, and some states, municipalities, and universities
* NASA's [Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACS)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/about/daacs)[^DAAC] - the 12 distributed data centers supported by NASA that provide discovery and access to different thematic collections of Earth science data. 
* UNM's [digital repository](http://digitalrepository.unm.edu)[^Lobo] - the designated *institutional repository* for the University of New Mexico.  

## Open Data: Where?

Requirements for repository services will vary from case to case, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Relevant factors include:

* Trusted repository status
* Capacity and commitment to preservation
* Provision of permanent identifiers (DOI)
* Format support
* Federation, discovery, and interoperability with other systems

Often these and other repository characteristics and policies are documented. Resources for identifying and assessing repositories include:

* PLOS ONE Data Availability policy (includes a [list of recommended repositories](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability)[^PLOS])
* Nature Scientific Data [Recommended Data Repositories](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories)[^NATURE]
* Scientific Data [recommended repositories](https://figshare.com/articles/Scientific_Data_recommended_repositories_June_2015/1434640)[^SciData]
* Registry of Research Data Repositories [(re3data.org)](https://www.re3data.org/)[^RE3DATA]
